note:
    ∙ Our tool Tellurium is based on something called a literate notebook.
    <br/>
    ∙ So, what exactly is a literate notebook? Well, in laboratory science, you always keep a lab notebook of your procedures and results. A literate notebook basically does the same thing for your computing studies. It stores your code along the results of running that so you can always so you can always retrace the steps used to produce a result. A notebook also contains narrative, which be in the form of text, images and equations that describe the science behind what you are doing, so that you can share your notebook with others and they should be able to follow your work. So, code cells and narrative cells are the two types of cells that exist in a regular literate notebook. Tellurium adds a third cell type for embedding standards directly in the notebook as COMBINE archives. You can run these COMBINE archives as part of the notebook to see the results of all simulations encoded in the archive, and you can also export the cell to a COMBINE archive on your disk so that it can be imported in other tools.
