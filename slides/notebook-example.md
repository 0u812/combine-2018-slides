note:
    ∙ All the examples I'm going to show you come from Tellurium's literate notebook.

    ∙ So, what exactly is a literate notebook? Well, in laboratory science, you always keep a lab notebook of your procedures and results. A literate computing notebook basically does the same thing automatically for your code. It always stores your results along with the code used to generate them, so you can always retrace your work. Moreover, it allows you to write formulas using LaTeX syntax, so it's actually quite useful for providing your students with interactive workbooks and exercises. In a notebook, there are usually two types of cells, and those are narrative cells which can contain verbiage, formulas and the like, and then there are code cells, which can run Python code. Tellurium adds a third cell type for COMBINE archives, so you can embed standards directly in your notebooks.
