##  Summary

* Standardization
  * Beneficial
  * But creates barriers
* Infrastructure
  * Overcome barriers
* Increased use of standards
* Better models

note:
    Standardization is beneficial but creates barriers. We created infrastructure to overcome the barriers. Our tool should lead to increased use of standards, which benefits modeling in systems biology.
