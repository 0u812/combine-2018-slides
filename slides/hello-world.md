Python code

note:
    ∙ Tellurium comes with something called a literate notebook. A literate notebook is a lot like a lab notebook. In a lab notebook, you record your procedures on one page and your results on the next page (or something like that). <br/>
    ∙ In a notebook cell, you can write down your code and it will be preserved, and you can then execute the code and the results will be displayed right beneath the code that generated it, so you always have code and results in a pair, and you can retrace your steps to recreate any of your results. That helps with reproducibility. <br/>
