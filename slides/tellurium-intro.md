note:
    ∙ Tellurium is an environment we developed to make working with standards easier.<br/>
    ∙ The thing that ties Tellurium together is the Python language, which is a commonly used language in scientific research and it's easy to learn.
    ∙ Tellurium supports standard encodings of models of course, that's its reason for existance.<br/>
    ∙ Tellurium allows you to encode models in standards without technical knowledge of those standards.<br/>
    ∙ It's designed to be used for research and teaching.
