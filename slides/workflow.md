note:
    âˆ™ In our case, we translate the COMBINE archive into a human-readable representation that can be edited by users. We want to show the user the contents of the archive without requiring them to understand the different standards involved or where the boundaries are between them are. Then, we want the user to be able to run all the simulations described in the archive, be able to edit the contents, and finally re-export to a COMBINE archive which can be read by other tools, and in the paper that accompanies this we demonstrated the ability to export our archives to iBioSim by Myers group at Utah and the SED-ML Web Tools by Frank Bergmann.
